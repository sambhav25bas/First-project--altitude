Project Statement – Atmospheric Pressure Variation with Altitude

Problem Statement
Aircraft performance is directly affected by atmospheric pressure, which decreases as altitude increases. This change in pressure influences lift, engine efficiency, and overall flight dynamics. The project aims to simulate atmospheric pressure variation using the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model through a Python program that calculates pressure at specific altitudes and visualizes the results.

Scope of the Project
The simulation will calculate atmospheric pressure from **0 to 11,000 meters** (troposphere region).
It will use ISA mathematical model for pressure estimation.
Graphical visualization will show how pressure decreases with altitude.
  
 Target Users
- Students learning basic aerospace concepts
- Beginners in Python programming
- Enthusiasts interested in atmospheric simulation and flight studies
