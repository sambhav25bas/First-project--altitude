TITLE- Atmospheric Pressure Variation with Altitude

Project Overview
This project simulates how atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude using the **International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model**. It calculates pressure for user-entered altitudes and visualizes pressure variation using a graph. This is a beginner-friendly aerospace engineering project built using Python and designed to link programming with real-world flight applications.


Features
✔ User input-based altitude calculation  
✔ Atmospheric pressure estimation using ISA model  
✔ Graph visualization using matplotlib  
✔ Real-time simulation with aerospace relevance  
✔ Beginner-friendly modular Python code  


 Objectives
- To apply the ISA atmosphere model using Python.
- To compute pressure variation from sea level up to 11,000 meters.
- To visualize the pressure vs altitude relationship.
- To demonstrate the impact of altitude on aircraft performance.
